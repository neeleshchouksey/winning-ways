                <p>While CashKaro is best known as a Cashback & Coupons site, we are also the best place to find great

                    we offer our users an unmatched cashback experience & curate awesome coupons. While there may be
                    other players in the market who offer coupons or cashback independently; we are the only site that
                    offers all 3 benefits together. We offer you cashback, price comparison of products across top
                    retailers and special coupon codes for 1500+ retailers.</p>

                    using our Android and iOS apps. Our cashback app offers superior UI & UX with handy features such as
                    on-screen coupon codes that you can simply tap to copy. This makes it easier to shop while you
                    browse through products across sites like Amazon, Flipkart, PayTm etc.</p>
                <p>
                    Finding the best offers on CashKaro is also extremely simple. To begin with, you have to create your
                    free CashKaro account; this gives you access to our exclusive deals, offers & coupon codes. Then
                    search for your favourite retailer in the search bar. This will take you to the retailer’s special
                    store page on our website. Here you will see the top offers, coupons and cashback deals along with
                    an orange “activate” button. If you like the offer you can click the orange button and you will see
                    a redirection page. This page will display all relevant coupon codes for the retailer you have
                    chosen. Next, you can simply paste the coupon code on the retailer’s checkout page and shop like you
                    normally do. We have multiple offers & coupons for each retailer so you can browse and find the one
                    best for you. The best part is we regularly update our cashback deals and coupons to ensure you get
                    the best offer on whatever you buy via CashKaro.
